        You are given an incomplete excerpt of an assistant response. The excerpt also contains 
        the system prompt of the assistant that generated the thoughts and the input user query.

        Reflect on the assistant thoughts and review them critically step-by-step before 
        completing the excerpt mindfully.

        Since he fails to generate the response based on his thought pattern, you have 
        to generate the response as if you would be the assistant.

        generate your response between tags like this:

        <response> your response </response>
